# TSA-Webmaster-2020-2021
This is the GitHub repository for the Middleton TSA Webmaster 2020-2021, as you can see, it is empty right now, because we don't have a website yet.

# Topic
Participants design, build, and launch a website that features the school’s career and technology/engineering program, TSA chapter, and the chapter’s ability to research and present a given topic pertaining to technology. Semifinalists participate in an onsite interview to demonstrate the knowledge and expertise gained during the development of the website—with an emphasis on web design methods and practices, as well as their research for the annual design topic.
